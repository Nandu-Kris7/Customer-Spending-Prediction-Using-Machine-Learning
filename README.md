# Customer-Spending-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
The goal of this project is to predict the yearly amount a customer spends based on various behavioral metrics collected from an e-commerce platform. By using linear regression, we analyze how factors like time spent on the app, time spent on the website, average session length, and membership duration influence customer spending.
